# Home Loan Status Prediction

## Project Overview
Business Understanding: Currently processing home loan application is done manually and it takes about 2-3 days to inform the applicant whether loan is approved or not.

Business Objective: Reduce the time taken to inform the applicants about home loan status

Hypothesis: Develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a loan application is approved or rejected with less amount of time

## Solution
Constructed a Flask web application with a Home Loan Status Prediction model that leveraged machine learning algorithms to predict loan approvals and rejections and decreased loan approval time by 90% 

Dockerized the application, implemented a CI/CD pipeline, and deployed the app on Azure

## Dataset
The dataset consisted of 12 independant variables and 1 dependant variable
#### Independant Variables:
- `Loan_ID` - unique identifier for each loan
- `Gender` - Gender of the loan applicant
- `Married` - Marital status of the loan applicant
- `Dependents` - Number of dependents for the loan applicant
- `Education` - Education status of the applicant. Whether the applicant is graduated or not
- `Self_Employed` - Whether the applicant is self employed or not
- `ApplicantIncome` - Monthly gross income of the applicant
- `CoapplicantIncome` - Monthly gross income of the Coapplicant
- `LoanAmount` - Loan amount needed by the applicant
- `Loan_Amount_Term` - Loan amount term required by the applicant (In months)
- `Credit_History` - 
- `Property_Area` - Whether the property area is Urban, Semi-urban or Rural
#### Dependant variable:
- `Loan_Status`
